			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<p>My name is Sharang (<em>Shaa-rung</em>) and I was born in Mumbai, India. I moved to the United States when I was nine years old and have lived here ever since. I did my undergraduate at Arizona State University, majoring in Computer Science and Economics.<br><br>

			After graduating from ASU, I worked for nearly two years in IT consulting as a software developer. <a class="link" href="/cv">Read more about my work experience. </a>I am very passionate about working in technology; my main interests are full stack programming, data analytics, and cloud computing.<br><br>

			Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology and Management at UT Austin where the course focuses on both the technical and business side of things. I studied numerous subjects including application development, data science, IT strategies and the networked economy, the Internet of Things, and various other emerging technologies.

			<p>As for my hobbies, I am a picky reader, but if I find a good fantasy or mystery novel, I do not put it down until I am finished. <br><br> I find solace in music and I think I have a wide range in taste with everything from classic/punk rock, 1960s hindi songs to raps from Hamilton in my playlist. I play a little bit of guitar myself and attempt to write songs once in a while.<br><br> Also, I am a huge sports buff and watch cricket (a religion as an Indian), football (or soccer), tennis, basketball, the other football, or really anything that is on. My allegiances as a fan lie with, in no particular order, the Indian national cricket team, Barcelona, Arsenal, Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals, and Rafael Nadal.</p>
