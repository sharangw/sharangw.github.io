			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I have two years of exeperience as a full stack developer where I helped built multi-tiered applications, utilizing technologies such as Angular, Spring, Hibernate, and SQL databases. I worked on both the backend and frontend sides of the application. Also, I participated in an agile team environment, following the Scrum framework on a daily basis. <br><br>

			I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology and Management where the course focuses on both the technical and business side of things. I am studying about various disciplines including application development, data science/analytics, IT strategies and the networked economy, the Internet of Things, and various other emerging technologies. <br><br>

			I want to use what I have learned in my Master's program along with my work experience at my next job where I hope to grow and advance my career as an IT professional. <br><br>
