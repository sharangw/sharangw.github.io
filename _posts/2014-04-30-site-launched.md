Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Thank you to Jonathan McGlone's [super simple guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)!
