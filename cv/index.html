		<h1>My Recent Work Experience</h1>

		<strong>UT Austin Capstone Project Data Engineer, Accruent</strong>	
		<p>I am working with Accruent as a part of a Capstone project team in my Master's program to build a machine learning or deep learning model on medical device repair/maintenance data and create a chatbot to expedite the repair process for said devices.<br><br>

		I completed data cleaning on raw work order data and scrapped information from technical service manuals and re-formatted the data in order to use it as part of a neural network model. Our team is currently in the midst of performing data analytics and extracting insights that could make a significant business impact.</p><br>

		<strong>Software Consultant, Capgemini</strong>
		<p>I was part of an agile/SCRUM team that worked on redesigning a legacy system by using newer technologies to build a more robust application with better user experience. I utilized technologies such as Angular, Spring, Hibernate, and SQL databases and worked on both the backend and frontend sides of the application. <br><br>

		I worked on the backend by writing easy to use and well documented REST APIs with Spring Boot and Java for financially significant business tools. I also was the chief front end developer on our team after taking over from a previous developer. I developed and maintained the user interface with Angular and JavaScript.<br><br>

		Moreover, I executed jobs in Jenkins and managed applications in PCF to ensure continuous delivery. Participated in and at times lead the production installation meetings to build and deploy our applications.<br><br>

		Lastly, I also assisted in the coordination of offshore resourcesâ€™ development tasks and performed code review on their work.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>I want to use what I have learned in my Master's program along with my professional experience at my next job where I hope to grow and advance my career as an IT professional.</p>
