		<h2>Academia</h2>

		<h3>MS, Information Technology and Management, University of Texas at Austin, 2019-2020</h3>

		<strong>UT Austin Capstone Project Data Engineer, Accruent</strong>	
		<p>I am working with Accruent as a part of a Capstone team in my Master's program to build a machine learning or deep learning model on medical device repair/maintenance data and create a chatbot to expedite the repair process for said devices.<br><br>

		I worked on data cleaning and scraped information from technical service manuals and work order data in order to use it as part of a neural network model. Our team is currently in the midst of performing data analytics and extracting insights which could make notable business impacts.</p><br>

		<strong>Software Consultant, Capgemini</strong>
		<p>I was part of an agile/SCRUM team that worked on redesigning a legacy system by using newer technologies to build a more robust application with better user experience. I was a full stack developer and thus worked on both the backend and frontend sides of the application. <br><br>

		I worked on the backend by writing easy to use and well documented REST APIs with Spring Boot and Java for financially significant business tools. Also, I was the chief front end developer on our team after taking over from an outgoing employee. I developed and maintained the user interface with Angular and JavaScript.<br><br>

		Moreover, I executed jobs in Jenkins and managed applications in PCF to ensure continuous delivery. Additionally, I participated in and at times lead the production installation meetings to build and deploy our applications.<br><br>

		Lastly, I assisted in the coordination of our offshore resourcesâ€™ development tasks and performed code review on their work.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>I want to utilize my professional experience along what I have learned in my Master's program to succeed at my next job where I hope to grow and advance my career as an IT professional.</p>
