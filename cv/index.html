		<h2>Professional Employment</h2>

		<p><strong>Software Consultant, Capgemini</strong></p>

		<p>I was part of an agile/SCRUM team that worked on redesigning a legacy system by using newer technologies to build a more robust application with better user experience. I was a full stack developer and thus worked on both the backend and frontend sides of the application. <br><br>

		I worked on the backend by writing easy to use and well documented REST APIs with Spring Boot and Java for financially significant business tools. Also, I was the chief front end developer on our team after taking over from an outgoing employee. I developed and maintained the user interface with Angular and JavaScript.<br><br>

		Moreover, I executed jobs in Jenkins and managed applications in PCF to ensure continuous delivery. Additionally, I participated in and at times lead the production installation meetings to build and deploy our applications.<br><br>

		Lastly, I assisted in the coordination of our offshore resources’ development tasks and performed code review on their work.</p>
